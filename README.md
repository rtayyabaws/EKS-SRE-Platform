# EKS SRE Platform

A production-style cloud-native platform deployed on Amazon EKS, demonstrating end-to-end infrastructure automation, GitOps delivery, security scanning, and full observability with Prometheus and Grafana.

**Live:** https://eks.nourdemo.com



## Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](/docs/screenshots/EKS%20Gitops%20Platform.gif)

The platform is built across three layers:

- **Infrastructure**: Terraform provisions a multi-AZ VPC, EKS cluster with managed node groups, IAM roles with OIDC federation, ECR, Route53, and ACM certificates. State is managed remotely in S3 with native S3 locking.
- **Platform**:  ingress-nginx, cert-manager, ExternalDNS, and kube-prometheus-stack are deployed via Helm and managed by Argo CD.
- **Application**: Python/FastAPI service with health, readiness, and Prometheus metrics endpoints, deployed via Argo CD with an HPA for autoscaling.



## Key Components

### Kubernetes & Argo CD

- **Amazon EKS**: managed Kubernetes control plane with node groups running in private subnets
- **Argo CD**: continuously reconciles the cluster against this Git repository; any merged change is reflected in the cluster automatically
- All application manifests (Deployment, Service, Ingress, HPA, ServiceMonitor) are version-controlled and GitOps-managed

![Argo CD — all apps synced and healthy](/docs/screenshots/argocd.png)

### Networking & Ingress

- **ingress-nginx**: the single entry point into the cluster, routing traffic based on Ingress rules
- **AWS Load Balancer**: receives public traffic and forwards to ingress-nginx
- **ExternalDNS**: watches Ingress resources and automatically creates/updates Route53 records; uses EKS Pod Identity to authenticate to AWS without storing credentials

### Certificate Management

- **cert-manager**: provisions and renews TLS certificates automatically via Let's Encrypt DNS-01 challenge through Route53
- Any Ingress annotated for TLS receives a valid certificate and Kubernetes secret; no manual renewal required

### Observability

- **Prometheus**: scrapes app metrics, kube-state-metrics, node-exporter, kubelet, and ingress-nginx via ServiceMonitors
- **Grafana**: visualises metrics through custom and imported dashboards; JSON exports committed to Git as reproducible infrastructure artifacts
- **Loki**:  deployed via Argo CD for log aggregation, with Promtail shipping logs from all pods across both nodes

### Autoscaling

- **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler**: scales the FastAPI app between 2 and 6 replicas based on CPU utilisation
- **metrics-server**: deployed via Argo CD, provides the Kubernetes Metrics API that feeds real-time CPU data to the HPA

### Security

- **No long-lived credentials**: GitHub Actions authenticates to AWS via OIDC federation; no static keys stored in secrets
- **Trivy**: scans every Docker image for vulnerabilities before it reaches ECR
- **Checkov**:  runs against all Terraform manifests on every pipeline run; failures are documented and suppressed with explicit reasoning in `.checkov.yaml`
- **Private node groups**: EKS workers run in private subnets; only the load balancer is public-facing
- **Least-privilege IAM**: each workload component (ExternalDNS, cert-manager) has its own scoped IAM role via Pod Identity

## CI/CD Pipelines

### Pipeline 1 — App CI (`app-ci.yml`)

Triggered on push to `main` for changes under `app/` or `helm/`:

1. Docker image build
2. Trivy vulnerability scan
3. Push to ECR (tagged with Git SHA)
4. Update Helm values with new image tag
5. Commit back to Git with `[skip ci]` — Argo CD detects the change and syncs

![App CI Pipeline](/docs/screenshots/app%20ci.png)

### Pipeline 2 — Terraform Plan (`terraform-plan.yml`)

Triggered on pull requests touching `terraform/`:

1. `terraform fmt` and `terraform validate`
2. Checkov IaC security scan
3. `terraform plan` — shows exactly what will change

![Terraform Plan Pipeline](/docs/screenshots/terraform%20plan.png)

### Pipeline 3 — Terraform Apply (`terraform-apply.yml`)

Manual trigger only and provisions or updates AWS infrastructure:

1. `terraform apply -auto-approve`
2. Bootstraps ArgoCD via Helm
3. Applies root app — ArgoCD takes over and syncs the full platform

![Terraform Apply Pipeline](/docs/screenshots/tf%20apply%20pipeline.png)

### Pipeline 4 — Terraform Destroy (`terraform-destroy.yml`)

Manual trigger only and tears down infrastructure cleanly:

1. Deletes ingress-nginx service to release the AWS NLB before VPC deletion
2. `terraform destroy` scoped to exclude the OIDC provider and GitHub Actions role

![Terraform Destroy Pipeline](/docs/screenshots/terraform%20destroy.png)

---

## GitOps Flow

```
git push → GitHub Actions → ECR push → manifest update → Argo CD sync → EKS
```

Argo CD provides drift detection and self-healing. Rollbacks are a `git revert` — no manual cluster intervention required. The app of apps pattern (`root-app.yaml`) means a single manifest bootstraps the entire platform.

---

## Observability

### Grafana — SRE Application Dashboard

Custom dashboard tracking HTTP request rate by endpoint, average request latency, pod CPU and memory usage, and ready pod count. Dashboard JSON is committed to Git and reproducible as an infrastructure artifact.

![Grafana SRE Dashboard](/docs/screenshots/grafana%20dash1.png)

### Prometheus Targets

Prometheus scrapes:

- Application `/metrics` endpoint via ServiceMonitor
- `kube-state-metrics` — Kubernetes object state
- `node-exporter` — node CPU, memory, disk
- `kubelet` — pod and container metrics
- `ingress-nginx` — request rates and latency

![Prometheus Targets](/docs/screenshots/Prometheus.png)

---

## Autoscaling

The FastAPI app is configured with an HPA targeting 60% CPU utilisation, scaling between 2 and 6 replicas. The `/slow` endpoint performs CPU-intensive computation to drive CPU above the threshold, making it purpose-built for triggering and demonstrating autoscaling behaviour under load.

Load test (`scripts/load-test.sh`) sends 20 concurrent requests per second across all endpoints. Under sustained load the HPA scales from 2 replicas to 6 within minutes, then scales back down once traffic stops, demonstrating the full scale-out and scale-in cycle.

![HPA Scaling Demo](/docs/screenshots/hpa%20demo%20test%202%20.png)

---

## Live Application

The platform serves a real-time SRE status page at [eks.nourdemo.com](https://eks.nourdemo.com) showing live platform health, service status, Prometheus metrics, and Kubernetes pod information. All pulled directly from the running application.

![Status Page](/docs/screenshots/Status%20website.png)

## Application Endpoints

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /` | Root response |
| `GET /healthz` | Liveness probe |
| `GET /readyz` | Readiness probe |
| `GET /slow` | CPU-intensive endpoint for load testing and HPA demonstration |
| `GET /metrics` | Prometheus metrics |

---

## Deployment

### Prerequisites

- AWS CLI configured
- Terraform >= 1.5
- `kubectl`, `helm`, `argocd` CLI

### 1. Bootstrap state backend

```bash
cd terraform/bootstrap
terraform init && terraform apply
```

### 2. Provision infrastructure and bootstrap platform

```bash
cp terraform/terraform.tfvars.example terraform/terraform.tfvars
# fill in your values
cd terraform
terraform init
terraform apply
```

The apply pipeline also handles ArgoCD installation and platform bootstrap automatically. To run manually after apply:

```bash
aws eks update-kubeconfig --region eu-west-2 --name eks-sre-platform
helm repo add argo https://argoproj.github.io/argo-helm
helm upgrade --install argocd argo/argo-cd -n argocd --create-namespace --wait
kubectl apply -f argocd/apps/root-app.yaml
```

Argo CD reconciles all platform components from Git automatically.

### 3. Tear down

```bash
# Via pipeline (recommended) — handles NLB cleanup automatically
# Trigger terraform-destroy.yml from GitHub Actions

# Or locally
kubectl delete svc ingress-nginx-controller -n ingress-nginx
sleep 90
cd terraform && terraform destroy \
  -target=module.eks \
  -target=module.vpc \
  -target=module.ecr \
  -target=aws_eks_pod_identity_association.external_dns
```

> The OIDC provider and GitHub Actions IAM role are excluded from destroy to preserve CI/CD pipeline functionality on next apply.

## Cost Estimate

Approximate monthly cost when running:

| Resource | Cost |
|---|---|
| EKS control plane | ~£57 |
| EC2 worker nodes (2× t3.medium) | ~£47 |
| NAT gateways (2×) | ~£25 |
| Load balancer | ~£13 |
| ECR, S3, Route53 | ~£4–8 |
| **Total** | **~£146–150/month** |

> Tear down with the destroy pipeline when not in use.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Terraform destroy hangs on VPC deletion

**Problem:** `terraform destroy` pends indefinitely when deleting the VPC.

**Cause:** ingress-nginx creates an AWS Network Load Balancer outside of Terraform's state. AWS refuses to delete the VPC while the NLB is still attached.

**Fix:** Delete the ingress-nginx controller service first to release the NLB, wait 90 seconds for AWS to deprovision it, then run destroy. The destroy pipeline handles this automatically.

---

### GitHub Actions S3 403 on state access

**Problem:** Terraform plan/apply pipeline fails with `AccessDenied` on S3 `HeadObject`.

**Cause:** The GitHub Actions IAM role was missing S3 permissions for the Terraform state bucket.

**Fix:** Added `s3:GetObject`, `s3:PutObject`, `s3:DeleteObject`, `s3:ListBucket` to the GitHub Actions role policy in `modules/iam/main.tf`.

---

### Stale Terraform state lock

**Problem:** `Error acquiring the state lock` when running Terraform locally after a cancelled pipeline.

**Cause:** Cancelling a GitHub Actions pipeline mid-run leaves the S3 lock file (`terraform.tfstate.tflock`) in place.

**Fix:** Delete the lock file directly from S3:

```bash
aws s3api delete-object \
  --bucket eks-sre-platform-terraform-state \
  --key platform/terraform.tfstate.tflock \
  --region eu-west-2
```

---

### OIDC provider destroyed breaking CI/CD

**Problem:** GitHub Actions pipeline fails with `No OpenIDConnect provider found` after a full `terraform destroy`.

**Cause:** The OIDC provider was destroyed along with the rest of the infrastructure, removing the trust relationship that allows GitHub Actions to authenticate to AWS.

**Fix:** Added `lifecycle { prevent_destroy = true }` to the OIDC provider and GitHub Actions IAM role. The destroy pipeline uses `-target` to exclude these resources. If ever accidentally destroyed, recreate manually:

```bash
aws iam create-open-id-connect-provider \
  --url https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  --client-id-list sts.amazonaws.com \
  --thumbprint-list 6938fd4d98bab03faadb97b34396831e3780aea1
```

---

### HPA showing `<unknown>` targets

**Problem:** `kubectl get hpa` shows `cpu: <unknown>/60%` and pods never scale.

**Cause:** metrics-server was not deployed, so the Kubernetes Metrics API was unavailable and HPA had no CPU data source.

**Fix:** Added metrics-server as an Argo CD managed application (`argocd/apps/metrics-server.yaml`). Once deployed, `kubectl top pods` returns real data and HPA scales correctly.

---

## Operational notes

- GitOps with Argo CD means Git is the only interface for deployments — no manual `kubectl apply`, no configuration drift, rollbacks are a `git revert`
- Committing Grafana dashboard JSON to Git treats observability as infrastructure, not manual ops configuration
- OIDC federation eliminates the operational risk of long-lived AWS credentials in CI/CD — the GitHub Actions role assumes permissions per-job with no stored secrets
- HPA requires both a manifest and a metrics source — the HPA spec alone does nothing without metrics-server providing the Kubernetes Metrics API
- `time.sleep()` in a FastAPI endpoint does not generate CPU load — HPA measures CPU utilisation, not request latency; CPU-intensive computation is required to trigger scaling
- Real operational issues (state locks, NLB blocking VPC deletion, OIDC provider lifecycle) surface the kind of judgment that doesn't come from tutorial projects
